test# TempShare

TempShare is a simple project I’m building to learn how file-sharing apps work.  
The idea is straightforward: upload a file, get a link, share it, and the file disappears after some time or downloads.

This is a learning-focused full-stack project using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend.

## What this project does

- Upload files and generate a shareable link  
- Download files using that link  
- Automatically remove files after expiry  
- Basic tracking for uploads and downloads  

Nothing fancy yet — the goal is to understand how things work under the hood.
